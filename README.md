# Ansible Role: BorgBackup Client

[![Test](https://github.com/borgbase/ansible-role-borgbackup/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/borgbase/ansible-role-borgbackup/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Ansible Galaxy](https://img.shields.io/ansible/role/48519)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/m3nu/ansible_role_borgbackup)

Set up encrypted, compressed and deduplicated backups using [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Borgmatic](https://github.com/witten/borgmatic). Currently supports Debian/Ubuntu, CentOS/Red Hat/Fedora, Archlinux and Manjaro.

Works great with [BorgBase.com](https://www.borgbase.com) - Simple and Secure Hosting for your Borg Repositories. To manage BorgBase repos via Ansible, also see Andy Hawkins' [BorgBase Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/adhawkins/borgbase).

Main features:
- Set up Borg and Borgmatic
- Add cron job at random time
- Provision new remote [BorgBase.com](https://www.borgbase.com) repo for storing backups (optional)
