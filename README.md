# Ansible Role: BorgBackup Client

[![Test](https://github.com/borgbase/ansible-role-borgbackup/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/borgbase/ansible-role-borgbackup/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Ansible Galaxy](https://img.shields.io/ansible/role/48519)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/m3nu/ansible_role_borgbackup)

Set up encrypted, compressed and deduplicated backups using [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Borgmatic](https://github.com/witten/borgmatic). Currently supports Debian/Ubuntu, CentOS/Red Hat/Fedora, Archlinux and Manjaro.

Works great with [BorgBase.com](https://www.borgbase.com) - Simple and Secure Hosting for your Borg Repositories. To manage BorgBase repos via Ansible, also see Andy Hawkins' [BorgBase Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/adhawkins/borgbase).

Main features:
- Set up Borg and Borgmatic
- Add systemd timer random time
- Provision new remote [BorgBase.com](https://www.borgbase.com) repo for storing backups (optional)

## Role Variables

### Required Arguments
- `borg_repository`: Full path to repository. Your own server or [BorgBase.com](https://www.borgbase.com) repo. Not required when using auto creation of repositories. Can be a list if you want to backup to multiple repositories.


### Optional Arguments
- `borg_dep_packages`: Dependancy Packages to install `borg(backup)` and `borgmatic`.
- `borg_distro_packages`: contains the names of distributions packages for `borg(backup)` and `borgmatic`, only used if `borg_install_method` is set to `package`.
- `borg_encryption_passcommand`: The standard output of this command is used to unlock the encryption key.

- `borg_install_method`: By default `pip` is used to install borgmatic. To install via your distributions package manager set this to `package` and (if needed) overwrite the `borg_distro_packages` variable to contain your distributions package names required to install borgmatic. Note that many distributions ship outdated versions of borgbackup and borgmatic; use at your own risk.

- `borg_retention_policy`: Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category (daily, weekly, monthly, etc).

- `borg_ssh_command`: Command to use instead of just "ssh". This can be used to specify ssh options.
- `borg_version`: Force a specific borg version to be installed
- `borg_venv_path`: Path to store the venv for `borg(backup)` and `borgmatic`

- `borgmatic_check_last`: Number of archives to check. Defaults to `3`

- `borgmatic_config_name`: Name to use for the borgmatic config file. Defaults to `config.yaml`
- `borgmatic_timer_hour`: Hour when regular create and prune cron/systemd-timer job will run. Defaults to `{{ 6 | random }}`
