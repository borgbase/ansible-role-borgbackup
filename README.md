    token: "Your Borgbase API Token"
    new_ssh_key: True
    ssh_key: "{{ some_variable }}"

    quota: 1000 #in GB
    region: eu
    alertdays: 2

- [x] Testing
- [ ] Multiple repos in one role-call instead of callng this role multiple times.
- [ ] Support more OSs, like Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS, SuSE, Gentoo, Slackware, Arch, BSD
