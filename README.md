# Ansible Role: BorgBackup Client

An Ansible Role that sets up automated remote backups on the target machine. Uses [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Borgmatic](https://github.com/witten/borgmatic). Currently supports Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS/RHEL/Fedora.

## Role Variables

### Required Arguments
- `borg_repository`: Full path to repository. Your own server or [BorgBase.com](https://www.borgbase.com) repo.
- `borg_source_directories`: List of local folders to back up.

### Optional Arguments
- `borg_encryption_passphrase`: Password to use for repokey or keyfile. Empty if repo is unencrypted.
- `borgmatic_large_repo`: Does repo-checking on a weekly basis instead of daily. Good for repos with 100GB+ size.
- `borgmatic_failure_command`: Run this command when an error occurs. E.g. `curl -s -F "token=xxx" -F "user=xxx" -F "message=Error during backup" https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json`
- `borg_exclude_patterns`: Paths or patterns to exclude from backup. See [official documentation](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/help.html#borg-help-patterns) for more.
- `borg_one_file_system`: Don't cross file-system boundaries. Defaults to `true`
- `borg_exclude_from`: Read exclude patterns from one or more separate named files, one pattern per line.
- `borg_ssh_command`: Command to use instead of just "ssh". This can be used to specify ssh options.
- `borg_encryption_passcommand`: The standard output of this command is used to unlock the encryption key.
- `borg_retention_policy`: Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category (daily, weekly, monthly, etc).
